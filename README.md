### Datasets and Features

#### Police Serviced 911 Calls (2022)
- **Attributes:** `incident_type`, `priority_level`, `response_time`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- **Purpose:** Crime pattern detection, emergency response analysis, and law enforcement resource optimization.

#### Fire Investigations Dataset
- **Attributes:** `fire_incident_location`, `cause_classification`, `damage_estimates`
- **Purpose:** Infrastructure vulnerability assessment, correlation analysis with high-crime areas.

#### Public Transit Security Data
- **Datasets:** `SMART_Bus_Stops`, `DDOT_Bus_Routes`
- **Attributes:** `transit_stop_location`, `route_coverage`, `crime_incident_near_stop`
- **Purpose:** Identifying transit-related crime risks and evaluating security measures at public transport hubs.

#### Behavioral Risk Surveillance System
- **Attributes:** `unemployment_rate`, `substance_abuse_prevalence`, `mental_health_statistics`
- **Purpose:** Analyzing socio-economic determinants of crime, aiding predictive security modeling.

### Data Processing & Analysis
-  **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping high-crime zones and emergency response inefficiencies.
-  **Heatmap Visualization**: Identifying spatial clusters of emergency incidents.
-  **Predictive Modeling**: Leveraging AI and machine learning for crime pattern forecasting.

### Data Source
This dataset is sourced from the **Detroit Open Data Portal** and is used to develop an AI-powered security framework. It provides a **multi-dimensional security assessment** to enhance crime prevention strategies in high-risk urban areas.
